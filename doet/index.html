	<h1>Exercise 1</h1>
	<h2> 1. The Faucet </h2>
	<img src="../pictures/faucet.png" width="300" height="250">
	<p> A faucet in a restroom is supposed to supply water to 
		wash your hands. The faucet is way too close to the back
		of the sink. When users runs the water over their hands, their hands
		will touch the back of the sink. This is unsanitary and defeats
		the purpose of cleaning your hands in the first place. Additionally,
		the way in which you turn on the faucet is confusing. It looks like 
		you're supposed to press down to release the water, but you're supposed
		to turn it. This means that the learnability is low.
		The handle is too small to comfortably grip and turn. This is problematic
		for people with disabilities. That also means
		that the user is less likely to turn off the water while they scrub their hands
		and this wastes water. It is also not that sanitary to turn off the faucet after 
		you've washed. This design is inefficient and uncomfortable to use, spreading
		bacteria and wasting water. There is also no color indicator to tell what
		tempature of the water you're getting. </p>
		
	<p> To fix this problem, the faucet should be positioned so that the water comes
		out at a comfortable distance from the back of the sink. Users should have sufficient
		space to rinse their hands. The faucet should also be motion activated and release
		water at a comfortable room temperature. This way, 
		users can turn on the water without touching the faucet. This would avoid the spreading
		of germs from the bathroom and the water would automatically turn off when users
		are scrubbing their hands or done. This would also solve the problem of the water turning off
		when the user wasn't done washing their hands, which is common with the press down
		faucets. 
	</p>

	<h2> 2. Foot Door Opener </h2>
	<img src="../pictures/bathroom.png" width="300" height="250">
	<p> If a design needs a note and sign demonstration, it probably means that the design
		is not good and has low learnability. The purpose of the foot door opener is to avoid 
		touching the handle as you exit. I love foot door openers, but not the one in the women's
		restroom in Building 35. The user needs to turn the handle anyways
		to open the latch, which defeats the purpose of the foot door opener. It also is not
		very accessible to people with disabilities.
	</p>

	<p> 
		There are a few ways we could solve this problem. The first would be to get rid of the 
		latch and turning door handle entirely and replace it with a simple pulling handle (for
		people who do not wish to pull the door with their foot)/. Another way to solve this issue is to make
		the door motion activated so that it will open automatically when the user walks through.
		It can be a mental or physical barrier to open doors (especially if it is heavy or hard to open), 
		so it would be much simpler to just walk through.

	<h2> 3. Apple Pencil Charging </h2>

	<img src="../pictures/pencil.jpg" width="350" height="250">
	<p> 
		This was the iPad and Apple Pencil that MIT loaned me for educational use. Throughout the semesters
		I have used this Apple Pencil, I've been frustrated by a poorly designed feature: charging.
		As shown in the photo, the Apple Pencil is charged by removing the cap and inserting it in the iPad 
		charging port. This has safety issues because there is nothing supporting the pencil and it can easily
		be bent or broken, leaving the charging USB inside the iPad port. When I am charging the pencil, I
		cannot use the pencil. There have been many times where I am taking notes in class and the pencil dies, and I need
		to charge it for 20 minutes before I can use it again. It is so inconvenient to charge and I can't passively
		charge it when I put it in my backpack because of how it sticks out from the iPad. I can't charge my iPad and charge
		the pencil at the same time. Additionally, because I need to remove the cap to charge the pencil, the cap is so easy 
		to lose and there isn't a good place to hold onto it. Often times, I just take off the cap entirely, but this leaves 
		the pencil USB exposed and prone to damage.
	</p>
	<p>
		To fix this problem, I would suggest a magnetic or wireless charging system where the pencil attaches to the
		side of the iPad. This would allow the pencil to be charged passively when not in use, but still attached
		to the iPad so that it won't get lost. This is a much safer and more convenient way to charge the pencil.
		The pencil would not need a cap, and you could charge the iPad at the same time the pencil is charging.
		There is less risk of the pencil breaking from the iPad because the whole pencil is supported on the side
		of the iPad.
